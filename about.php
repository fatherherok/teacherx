              <h3>Welcome to TeacherX</h3>
              <p>TeacherX is a professional networking community for teachers with the X-factors all over the world. As collaboration is at the heart of professional growth in the 21st century, it is therefore, healthy to compete to collaborate. The space for professional connection is therefore one of the most important spaces educators cannot do without.

</p>

              <p>Solitude in journey can bring speed, however, flocking together breeds strength and sustainability. The best teacher in the 21st century is that teacher who sets aside competition but connect and collaborate to provide quality education.

TeacherX hence provides a platform for educators to connect, communicate and collaborate using a community space, access to and creation of courses and sharing of digital resources.</p>
